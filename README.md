# GROMACS Simulation Workflows

## Overview
This repository contains reusable template files and scripts
for setting up and running molecular dynamics simulations
using GROMACS.

The goal is to provide a clean, reproducible workflow that
can be adapted for proteins, enzymes, and protein–ligand systems.

## Contents
- Standard .mdp files for minimization, NVT, NPT, and production MD
- Example shell script for running simulations
- Notes describing best practices and workflow logic

## Tools
- GROMACS
- Linux shell scripting

## Notes
These templates are for demonstration and educational purposes.
No proprietary data or unpublished research is included.
